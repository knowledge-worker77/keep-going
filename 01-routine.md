## Daily routine

Creativity is not a linear process, sometimes you have to look back, sometimes we have to start again from scratch.

Our lives are full of ups and downs but being creative in the midst of chaos can only be possible if you have and follow a daily routine. A daily routine will keep you occupied and make you enjoy your time.

Sometimes you won't be able to follow your daily routine and will need to do things that you never planned on doing. But the important thing to remember is that you finished some tasks and not all.
