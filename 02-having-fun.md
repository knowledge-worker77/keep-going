## Having fun

You need to enjoy the work you do each day. If you don't then just change your process of doing that.

Learn to accept change for the better. Shake up things every once in a while. Wake up each day with a goal and work towards completing that goal.

You'll see that people put a lot of effort on their titles and not much in their work. Forget your title, just immerse yourself in work. Let your work define you.
